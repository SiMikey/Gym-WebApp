          <h3>Scrambled eggs</h3>
          <p>
            Eggs have been a dietary staple since time immemorial and there’s
            good reason for their continued presence in our menus and meals. One
            large boiled egg has about 77 calories and contains: Vitamins A, B5,
            B12, D, E, K, B6 Folate Phosphorus Selenium Calcium Zinc Six grams
            of protein Five grams of healthy fats “Eggs are a good source of
            protein (both whites/yolk). They also contain heart-healthy
            unsaturated fats and are a great source of important nutrients, such
            as vitamin B6, B12 and vitamin D,” says Kurt Hong, MD, an internal
            medicine specialist at Keck Medicine of USC.
